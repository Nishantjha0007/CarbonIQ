⚡ Overview

CarbonIQ is a blockchain-based Blue Carbon Registry and MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) system built to ensure transparency, trust, and decentralization in India’s carbon credit ecosystem.
It integrates IoT sensors, drones, AI/ML, and blockchain to verify blue carbon restoration and generate trustworthy carbon credits — empowering coastal communities and supporting India’s Net Zero 2070 mission.

🎯 Problem

India lacks a decentralized MRV system for blue carbon monitoring.
Current systems are fragmented, centralized, and dependent on expensive third-party audits.

Key Issues:

Scattered and non-standardized field data

Weak stakeholder participation

Unverified carbon credits

No integrated app combining field data, verification, and credit generation

💡 Solution

CarbonIQ creates a trustless, India-focused MRV platform with:

🛰️ Multi-source data fusion (satellite, drone, IoT)

🔗 Blockchain-based credit issuance via smart contracts

🧠 ML models for carbon estimation

👥 Three-tier community verification (local → technical → NCCR)

💰 Tokenized marketplace for blue carbon credits

🧱 Tech Stack
Layer	Technologies
Frontend	React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
Backend	Express, Flask, Firebase
Blockchain	Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, Ethereum
Storage	IPFS / Pinata
AI/ML	Python (XGBoost, Random Forest, Ridge Regression)

Each tree or restoration plot is tracked using a unique QR code for transparency.

🧩 System Architecture

Data Input: IoT sensors, drones, and satellite imagery

Processing: AI-driven carbon estimation and automated MRV

Verification: Community → Technical → NCCR

Blockchain: Smart contracts for carbon token creation and transfer

💰 Marketplace & Business Model

Carbon Credit Dashboard: Converts ML-predicted carbon into tokenized, verifiable credits.

Marketplace: Trades credits directly, rewarding local communities.

Revenue Model: Registry fees, SaaS APIs, MRV-as-a-Service, and analytics subscriptions.

🌿 Impact

Environmental:

Accelerated blue carbon sequestration (up to 5× forest rate)

Biodiversity and coastal resilience

Social:

Community livelihoods and green jobs

Local transparency via blockchain MRV

Economic:

Verified emission reductions and new income streams

Premium credits attract global climate investors
