🌍 CarbonIQ — Blockchain-Based Blue Carbon Registry & MRV System
Smart India Hackathon 2025 | Team KALKI (Team ID: 103016)

Problem Statement ID: 25038
Theme: Clean & Green Technology | Category: Software

🚀 Overview

CarbonIQ is a blockchain-based Blue Carbon Registry and MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) platform designed to revolutionize India’s approach to blue carbon credit management.
It ensures transparency, trust, and decentralization by combining IoT sensors, drones, AI/ML, and blockchain — empowering coastal communities while supporting India’s Net Zero 2070 mission.

🏆 Developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2025 under the Clean & Green Technology theme.

🎯 Problem Statement

India currently lacks a verifiable and decentralized MRV system for blue carbon monitoring.
Existing platforms are centralized, rely heavily on costly third-party audits, and fail to integrate field-level data (from drones, IoT, and local communities).

Key challenges:

Fragmented and non-standardized field data

Weak stakeholder inclusion

Lack of trust in carbon credit authenticity

Absence of app-based integrated MRV and credit systems

💡 Our Solution — CarbonIQ

A Blockchain-Integrated Blue Carbon Registry and Marketplace that:

🛰️ Uses Satellite + Drone + IoT + ML for automated carbon monitoring

🔗 Employs Blockchain smart contracts for transparent credit generation

🧠 Utilizes AI/ML for accurate carbon stock estimation

👥 Enables Community-based verification (3-tier trust model)

💰 Tokenizes carbon credits for direct community income

🌊 Focuses exclusively on India’s blue carbon ecosystems
